Tank Defence: Readme
====================

Outline:
-------
The purpose of the game is to destroy the aliens invading the city. The player
controls a tank. The player can move backwards and forwards and move the tank
turret up and down. The player can control the power that the canon shoots from
the tank.

The framework for the game is designed. I intend to add more levels. I intend to 
add points so that the player can get points for destroying the aliens. 

The levels will have different layouts. The buildings will be made out of the
same graphics. However, there will be levels with more than one building. 
Levels will increase in difficulty. The difficulty can be increased by both 
increasing the frequency of UFOs and by making the target alien eggs harder to
destroy by placing them in more indirect paths for the canon to reach.
When the player reaches a certain amount of points, they will be
awarded an extra life. 

How to Play
